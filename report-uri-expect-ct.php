 * This script accepts incoming Expect-CT compliance reports and emails their
 * contents to the site administrator. For more about the Expect-CT header, see:
 *
 * <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-expect-ct-02>
 * <https://scotthelme.co.uk/a-new-security-header-expect-ct/>
 *
 * Point to this script in the "report-uri" parameter of your Expect-CT header.
 *
 * Some browsers send an OPTIONS request first, prior to POSTing the report,
 * to ensure the server is willing to accept a POST in the first place. This 
 * is known as a "preflight," as defined here:
 *
 * <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#Preflighted_requests>
 *
 * The appropriate response will be sent depending upon the HTTP verb.
